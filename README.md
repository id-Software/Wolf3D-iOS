#  Wolfenstein 3D for iOS 11 and tvOS for Apple TV

&nbsp;

This is my update for Wolfenstein 3D for iOS to run on iOS 11, running in modern resolutions including the full width of the iPhone X. I have also made a target and version for tvOS to run on Apple TV

Improvements/Changes

- Compiles and runs in iOS 11 SDK
- Orientation and coordinate system fixed to reflect iOS 8 changes
- C warnings fixed for Xcode 9.3
- Basic MFi controller support
- Deprecated APIs removed and replaced with modern equivalents
- Code locations reorganized and consolodated
- Second project target for tvOS that takes advantage of focus model and removes on-screen controls.

For a rundown of getting the code up and running in iOS 11, I wrote this [lengthy article](http://schnapple.com/wolfenstein-3d-and-doom-on-ios-11/) on the subject. For a rundown of the effort to get it running on tvOS, I wrote a [second lenghty article](http://schnapple.com/wolfenstein-3d-and-doom-on-tvos-for-apple-tv/) on the subject.
